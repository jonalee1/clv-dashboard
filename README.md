A Probabilistic CLV
(1) Retention Models: Beta-Geometric retention rate 
(2) Frequency Models: Compare Poisson vs. Negative Binomial PMFs with adjustable λ, α, β, and event count range.
(3) Monetary Model: Visualize the Gamma–Gamma PDF for transaction values and compute the expected order value with adjustable shape, scale, and x-axis range.
